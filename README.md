The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway system is a critical part of Toronto's public transportation network, servicing over a million riders daily across multiple lines. However, subway delays have been a persistent issue, impacting the efficiency and reliability of the service. Understanding the primary causes of these delays and how they vary by time of day and across different subway lines is essential for improving service quality and enhancing passenger experience.

This study aims to investigate the following questions:

1. What are the primary causes of subway delays in Toronto and how do these delays vary by subway line/station?
2. Can we estimate the duration of subway delays across Torontoâ€™s TTC system based on different predictors?
